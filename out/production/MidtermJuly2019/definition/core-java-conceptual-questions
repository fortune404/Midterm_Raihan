Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.
A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for
instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.



What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.
JDK contains Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java),
a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc)
and other tools needed in Java development.


What is IDE?
A.
Integrated development Environment


What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A.
IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans.


Explain the entire java life cycle.
A.
Initially Java source code is written in an editor. Those written codes are
saved into a Source file, whose extension is .java. Next step is to compile
the source code, means translating into bytecode. Bytecode works machine
language for JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and it's extension for .class .
JVM uses 4 of its major components to run a java program:
(a) Class loader loads the bytecode from hard drive into RAM (since JVM
resides on RAM-Random Access Memory).
(b) then the bytecode goes through bytecode verifier. (c) bytecode verifier
verifies that no unnecessary classes can be run on JVM meaning java is secured and
(d)after that byte codes go to Execution engine, which translates bytecode into
native machine code, with the help of JIT Code Generator.


What is class?
A.
Class is a blueprint of an object.


What is object?
A.
An object is an instance of a class.


What is the entry point of an application?
A.
The main method:
public static void main (String[] args){}


Why main is static?
A.
It is necessary because main() is called by the JVM before any objects are made.
Since it is static it can be directly invoked via the class.


Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A.
Object class.


What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A.
Path variable is used to set the path for all Java software tools like java.exe,
javac.exe, javadoc.exe, and etc. Classpath is system environment variable used
by the Java compiler and JVM. Java compiler and JVM use class-path to determine
the location of required class files.


What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A.
Interface can only have abstract methods. Abstract classes can have both
abstract methods and regular method. Abstract method is a method with no body
and regular method is a method with body.


Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A.
Interfaces and abstract classes cannot be instantiated. The only way to use them is, for
a class to implement an interface or extend an abstract class.


what is Access Specifier?
A.
Access specifiers establish the permissions we have to access or modify members of
a class within a certain range.


What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A.
OOP stands for object oriented programming. All java applications are based on the
concept of objects.
Inheritance: this is when a class has access to the members of its parent without
having to be reimplemented.
Polymorphism: Polymorphism is when a class can change the methods of its parents class to
fit its specific needs as well as add its own members
Encapsulation: Encapsulation is when we restrict the scope of certain members so that they
cannot be manipulated outside of the class where they are defined, this is achieved
with the "private keyword".
Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of implementation hiding. we use it when we want
certain features to be implemented.


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A.
A package is simply a folder or directory that stores related files and applications for easy
access. The default package is an unnamed package. The unnamed package contains java classes
whose source files did not contain a package declaration.


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A.
API stands for Application programming interface. It is a set of definitions,communication
protocols and tools for building software. Such as Scanner, String, Math, Random, etc.


Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A.
Java does not allow multiple inheritance, only One parent can be inherited from,
but we can get around this by implementing as many interfaces as we want.


What is method overloading and when it happens?
A.
Method overloading is when different methods with same name can exist in the same class as long
as they have different parameters. This event occurs during compile time.


Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A.
Exceptions are any event that disrupt the natural flow of an application, but can be handled
without the need to terminate the application. You can handle an exception with a try
catch block or throws keyword.


What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A.
The static keyword indicates that a member belongs to a class rather than a object.
Static variables are shared by all objects and static methods can be accessed
without needing an object reference.


What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.
The final keyword indicates that a member cannot be changed once declared. A final
variable cannot be changed and a final method cannot be overridden.


What is final, finally and finalize?
A.
The final keyword indicates that a member cannot be changed once declared. A final
variable cannot be changed and a final method cannot be overridden. Finally is a block of code
that executes after a try catch block for code cleanup. Finalize is a method called by
java garbage collector that closes any open resources before destroying a object.


What is a constructor ?
A.
A constructor is created to initialize an object.


Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.
Yes.


If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A.
The default constructor.


What is "this" keyword in java ?
A.
The "this" keyword is used to reference the current object whose method is being called.


What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A.
The "super" keyword is a reference to the parent class of an object.


What is JVM stand for ?
A.
Java Virtual Machine.


Is JVM platform independent?
A.
Yes.


What version of java are you using?
A.
"11.0.2"


What is JAR stand for ?
A.
Java Archive.


What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.
JDK stores all the tools and files need by java to run properly, JVM is
the executioner of java byte code.


What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A.
JVM is the virtual machine that executes bytecode it is inside JRE which contains other
libraries and components needed to run java applications.


What is compile time and run time?
A.
Compile time is the stage when source code converted to byte code, runtime is when the
byte code is being executed.


What is heap?
A.
Heap is a section of ram in which all objects are stored.


How java manage it's memory?
A.
All references are stored in stack and all objects are stored in heap


What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.
-Once a String object is created it cannot be changed
-StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object.
-StringBuilder allows manipulating character sequences by appending,
deleting and inserting characters and strings.


What is Singleton class?
A.
A singleton class is a class that allows only one instance object to be created.


What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A.
Serialization is the process of converting objects to byte stream. The reverse process of
creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization


When to use transient variable in java?
A.
Java transient keyword is used in serialization. If you define any data member
as transient, it will not be serialized.


Difference between while and do..while loop?
A.
In while loop the condition is checked first and in do while the code executes and then
check the condition.


What is Enum?
A.
A Java Enum is a special Java type used to define collections of constants. More
precisely, a Java enum type is a special kind of Java class. An enum can contain
constants, methods etc


What is Iterator?
A.
An iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container,
particularly lists.


Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A.
Both represents the the same, so their values would be same when it comes to taking memory.


Why is String Immutable in Java?
A.
For efficiency and security reasons.


What is constructor chaining in Java?
A.
Constructors in Java. Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from
another constructor with respect to current object.


The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A.
A serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one garbage
collector thread for the garbage collector operation, while a parallel collector
uses multiple garbage collection threads for the garbage collection operation.


What is JIT stands for?
A.
Just In Time.


Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.
Garbage collection is the process of freeing space in the heap or the nursery for
allocation of new objects.


Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A.
No.


What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A.
Stack is the long term memory and heap is the short term memory. Whenever an object is created,
it's always stored in the Heap space and stack memory contains the reference to it. Stack
memory only contains local primitive variables and reference variables to objects in heap space.


What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A.
Java Reflection makes it possible to inspect classes, interfaces, fields and methods
at runtime, without knowing the names of the classes, methods and it is useful because it
supports dynamic retrieval of information about classes and data structures by name, and allows
for their manipulation within an executing Java program.


What is multithreading in java?
A.
Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
Thread is basically a lightweight sub-process, a smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing
and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.


What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A.
Synchronized keyword in Java is used to provide mutually exclusive access to a shared
resource with multiple threads in Java.


What is Framework?
A.
A framework defines a set of rules or best practices which we can follow in a systematic
way to achieve the desired results.


What are the testing Framework available in java?
A.
testNG and Junit.


Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A.
JUNit is one of the most popular testing frameworks used for unit testing for the
Java programming language.It’s an open-source testing framework used by countless
Java projects for writing and running tests.TestNG is another popular testing framework
used with Selenium WebDriver and is quite similar to JUnit, but with added functionalists
and features such as parallel test execution, parameterization, and more. It is inspired
by JUnit and NUnit.


What are the dependencies for this project?
A.
gson-2.6.2.jar
java-jason.jar

testng-6.8.7.jar


What is dependency injection in java?
A.
Dependency injection is a technique whereby one object or static method supplies the
dependencies of another object.


What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A.
Static binding in Java occurs during compile time while dynamic binding occurs during runtime.
